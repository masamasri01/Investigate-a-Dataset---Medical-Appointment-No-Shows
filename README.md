**Project: Investigating Factors Influencing Medical Appointment No-Shows**

**Overview:**
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing 110,527 medical appointment records to understand the factors influencing patient no-shows. The dataset includes 14 characteristics such as age, gender, and various health conditions. The goal was to uncover patterns and draw actionable insights to improve appointment adherence.
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
**Key Tasks:**

- **Data Wrangling:**
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
  - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency, and ensured data integrity by addressing anomalies.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - **Gender Analysis:** Determined that although females had more appointments, males had a higher percentage of show-ups.
  - **SMS Impact:** Found that sending SMS reminders significantly increased appointment show-up rates.
  - **Health Conditions:** Analyzed the effects of diabetes and hypertension on patient show-up rates.
  - **Neighborhood Influence:** Identified that certain neighborhoods, like Jardim Camburi, had higher show-up rates.
  - **Age Factor:** Discovered that younger patients were more likely to attend their appointments.

**Visualizations:**
- Created bar charts and pie charts to represent gender-specific show-up rates and the impact of SMS reminders.
- Generated histograms to illustrate age distribution related to appointment attendance.
- Used bar charts to show neighborhood distribution of show-ups and no-shows.

**Conclusions:**
- **Gender:** Males showed up more frequently relative to their appointment volume compared to females.
- **SMS Reminders:** SMS notifications effectively increase the likelihood of patients attending their appointments.
- **Neighborhood:** Jardim Camburi exhibited the highest show-up rate.
- **Age:** Younger patients are more likely to attend their appointments.

**Challenges:**
- Faced some ambiguity in the dataset descriptions, such as unclear definitions for the 'scholarship' and 'handcap' variables.

This project provided valuable insights into patient behavior and highlighted potential areas for improving appointment management and patient communication strategies.
